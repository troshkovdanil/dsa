# Design a food ordering system where your python program will run two threads

- Place Order: This thread will be placing an order and inserting that into a queue.
This thread places new order every 0.5 second. (hint: use time.sleep(0.5) function)

- Serve Order: This thread will server the order.
All you need to do is pop the order out of the queue and print it.
This thread serves an order every 2 seconds.
Also start this thread 1 second after place order thread is started.
